    "\n",
    "$$z = 1-x$$\n",
    "\n",

    "z \\geq y \\\\\n",
    "z \\leq x+y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If x and y are both 0, then z must be 0 by the third condition. If on the other hand either x or y is 1 then z must be 1 by the first and second conditions. If x and y are both 1, the first two conditions hold and the third just states that $z \\leq 2$ which is always going to be true. This new variable is effectively the larger of x and y. With negation and or, we have all we need to be [functionally complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness). Buts lets list the other basic logical operators out.\n",

    "\n",
    "If x is true, they y must be true, and if x is false y can be anything. This is satisfied by $$y \\geq x$$"
