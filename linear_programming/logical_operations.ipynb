If x and y are both 1, the first two conditions hold and the third just states that $z \\leq 2$ which is always going to be true. This new variable is effectively the larger of x and y. With negation and or, we have all we need to be [functionally complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness). Buts lets list the other basic logical operators out.\n",

Of course we don't need to do that, the general idea of this big M method can be applied directly once it becomes intuitive. For now, lets transform the constraints to the form expected by the big M method.\n",

In our example we could have used 120 and gotten away with it because while $x$ was bounded between -100 and 100, $|x-20|$ is bounded by 120. This number doesn't need to be exact, but don't use ten billion if the variables and expressions are close to 100 as doing so will make the problem harder to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we rearanged the inequalites to give so that they were all greater than or equal to. There is a handy shortcut to adding the M's. If the inequality is greater than or equal, then subtract the M because when the M. The intution here should be that when M's condition is triggered we will be asking for a constraint that is larger than a really negative number which should always be true and therefore not add anything new. If on ther other hand the inequality is less than or equal to, we need to add the M: When it is triggered we will need to be less than some really large number, also always true.\n",
